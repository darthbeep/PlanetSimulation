# PlanetSimulation
This is a simple planet simulation, where you give the mass the sun, and then can add planets using names, masses, and average distances from the object that they orbit. Most planets orbit the sun, but you can have moons as well. You can also view everything you have added, including their forces of gravity against what they orbit, their orbital speeds, and orbital periods.

Because of the fact that moons are essentially planets that just orbit other planets instead of the sun, some code is recycled. Therefore the text for adding moons will be the same as planets.
